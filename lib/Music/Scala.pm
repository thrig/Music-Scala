# is to preserve compatibility with how the code worked pre-Moo. Additional

# the same data in different guises (notes (as cents or ratios), (notes as)
# cents, (notes as) ratios).

Music::Scala - Scala scale support for Perl

  # or by cents -- mark well the quoting on 1200; Perl will map
  # things like a bare 1200.000 to '1200' which then becomes the
  # ratio 1200/1 which is wrong.

for example code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scala scale support for Perl: reading, writing, setting, and interval to
frequency conversion methods are provided. The L</"SEE ALSO"> section links to
the developer pages for the original specification, along with an archive of
scala files that define various tunings and temperaments.

=head2 SEVERAL WORDS REGARDING FLOATING POINT NUMBERS

Frequencies derived from scala scale calculations will likely need to be
rounded due to floating point number representation limitations:

  # octave, plus default concert pitch of 440, so expect 880
  my $scala = Music::Scala->new->set_notes('1200.000');

  $scala->interval2freq(1);   # 879.999999999999        (maybe)

  sprintf "%.*f", 0, $scala->interval2freq(1);   # 880  (for sure)

For more information, see:

L<http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html> "What Every
Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic". David
Goldberg, Computing Surveys, March 1991.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

The B<new> method accepts any of the L</"ATTRIBUTES"> as well as optionally one
of the B<file> => I<filename> or B<fh> => I<filehandle> arguments to read a
scala scale file from.

  $scala = Music::Scala->new(
    binmode => ':encoding(iso-8859-1):crlf',
    file    => 'foo.scl',
  );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Moo attributes via C<has> statements. These may throw exceptions if bad data is
passed (negative frequencies or the like). The sporadic use of B<get_*> and
B<set_*> accessors is due to compatibility with older versions of this module.
These may also be specified to B<new>:

  # equivalent ways to do the same thing
  $scala = Music::Scala->new( concertfreq => 443 );
  $scala->set_concertfreq(443);

=over 4

=item B<binmode> (B<get_binmode>, B<set_binmode>(I<binmode_layer>))

Gets or sets the default C<binmode> layer used in the B<read_scala> and
B<write_scala> methods (unless a custom I<binmode> argument is passed to those
calls). The scala scale files from C<www.huygens-fokker.org> tend to be in the
ISO 8859-1 encoding, mostly for the description and other such metadata fields.
Note that Perl on Windows systems tends to turn on C<:crlf>. For scala scale
files, it probably should be specified, regardless of the operating system.
Therefore, a reasonable default to set might be:

  $scala->set_binmode(':encoding(iso-8859-1):crlf');

Though this module does nothing by default for encoding.

=item B<concertfreq> (B<get_concertfreq>, B<set_concertfreq>(I<frequency>))

Gets or sets the concert frequency. C<440> (Hz) is the default.

=item B<concertpitch> (B<get_concertpitch>, B<set_concertpitch>(I<pitch>))

Gets or sets the MIDI pitch number that the I<concertfreq> maps to. C<69> by
default (as that is the MIDI number of A440).

=item B<description> (B<get_description>, B<set_description>("blah blah"))

Gets or sets the description of the scala data. This will be the empty string
if no description was read or set prior.

=item B<MAX_LINES>

Gets or sets the maximum lines to allow in an input scala scale file, C<3000>
by default.

=item B<notes>

Gets or sets the notes from the scala scale data loaded, if any. Mostly for
internal use; the B<get_cents>, B<get_notes>, or B<get_ratios> methods are
likely better means to access this information, and the B<read_scala>,
B<set_by_frequency>, or B<set_notes> methods better ways to set it.

=back

=head1 METHODS

Methods will throw exceptions under various conditions, mostly related to bad
input or scala scale data not being loaded.

=over 4

=item B<cents2ratio> I<cents>, [ I<precision> ]

Converts a value in cents (e.g. C<1200>) to a ratio (e.g. C<2>). An optional
precision for C<sprintf> can be supplied; the default precision is C<2>. There
are C<1200> cents in an octave (a doubling of the frequency).

=item B<freq2pitch> I<frequency>

Converts the passed frequency (Hz) to the corresponding MIDI pitch number using
the MIDI algorithm, as influenced by the B<concertfreq> attribute. Unrelated to
scala, but handy for comparison with results from B<interval2freq>.

This method *is not* influenced by the scala scale data, and always uses equal
temperament. See also B<pitch2freq>.

=item B<get_cents>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala scale data, except converted to
cents ("notes" may either be ratios or values in cents; this method ensures
that they are all represented in cents). Throws an exception if the notes have
not been set by some previous method call (one of the B<read_scala>,
B<set_by_frequency>, or B<set_notes> methods).

=item B<get_notes>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala, but throws an exception if this
field has not been set by some previous method. The notes are either real
numbers (representing values in cents, or 1/1200 of an octave (these may be
rarely be negative)) or otherwise integer ratios (e.g. C<3/2> or C<2> (these
may not be negative)).

  $scala->read_scala(file => $some_file);
  my @notes = $scala->get_notes;
  if (@notes == 12) { ...

The implicit C<1/1> for unison is not contained in the list of notes; the
first element is for the 2nd degree of the scale (e.g. the minor second of a
12-tone scale). Other implementations may differ in this regard.

=item B<get_ratios>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala, except converted to ratios
("notes" may either be ratios or values in cents; this method ensures that
these values are returned as ratios). Throws an exception if the notes have not
been set by some previous method call.

=item B<interval2freq> I<intervals ...>

Converts a list of passed interval numbers (as a list or a single array
reference) to frequencies (in Hz) that are returned as a list. Interval numbers
are integers, C<0> for unison (the B<concertfreq>), C<1> for the first interval
(which would be a "minor 2nd" for a 12-note scale, but something different for
scales of different composition), and so on up to the "octave." Negative
intervals take the frequency in the other direction, e.g. C<-1> for what in a
12-note system would be a minor 2nd downwards. Intervals past the "octave"
consist of however many "octaves" are present in the scale, plus whatever
remainder lies inside that "octave," if any. "octave" uses scare quotes due to
13% of the scala archive consisting of non-octave bounded scales; that is,
scales that do not repeat themselves when the frequency is doubled (see
the B<is_octavish> method for a test for that condition).

Conversions are based on the I<concertfreq> setting, which is 440Hz by default.
Use B<set_concertfreq> method to adjust this. An example that derives the
frequencies of C4 through B4 using the equal temperament tuning file from the
scala scale file archive:

  $scala->read_scala('equal.scl');
  $scala->set_concertfreq(261.63);
  my @freqs = map { sprintf '%.2f', $_ } 
    $scala->interval2freq(qw/0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11/);

Some scala files note what this value should be in the comments or description,
or it may vary based on the needs of the software or instruments involved.

There is no error checking for nonsense conditions: an interval of a 15th makes
no sense for a xylophone with only 10 keys in total. Audit the contents of the
scala scale file to learn what its limits are or screen for appropriate scales
depending on the application.

=item B<is_octavish>

Returns true if the scala scale has an ultimate ratio of 2:1, as well as no
negative or repeated ratios; false otherwise. Throws an exception if no scala
scale is loaded.

=item B<notes2cents> I<notes ...>

Given a list of notes, returns a list of corresponding cents. Used internally
by the B<get_cents> method.

=item B<notes2ratios> I<notes ...>

Given a list of notes, returns a list of corresponding ratios. Used internally
by the B<get_ratios> and B<interval2freq> methods.

=item B<pitch2freq> I<MIDI_pitch_number>

Converts the given MIDI pitch number to a frequency using the MIDI conversion
algorithm, as influenced by the I<concertfreq> setting.

This method *is not* influenced by the scala scale data, and always uses equal
temperament. See also B<freq2pitch>.

=item B<ratio2cents> I<ratio>, [ I<precision> ]

Converts a ratio (e.g. C<2>) to a value in cents (e.g. C<1200>). An optional
precision for C<sprintf> can be supplied; the default precision is C<2>.

=item B<read_scala> I<filename>

Parses a scala file. Will throw some kind of exception if anything at all is
wrong with the input. Use the appropriate C<get_*> methods to obtain the scala
data thus parsed. Comments in the input file are ignored, so anything
subsequently written using B<write_scala> will lack those. All ratios are made
implicit by this method; that is, a C<2> would be qualified as C<2/1>.

As an alternative, accepts also I<file> or I<fh> hash keys, along with
I<binmode> as in the B<new> method:

  $scala->read_scala('somefile');
  $scala->read_scala( file => 'file.scl', binmode => ':crlf' );
  $scala->read_scala( fh   => $input_fh );

=item B<set_by_frequency> I<root_frequency>, I<frequencies...>

Given a root frequency as the first argument, performs the equivalent of
B<set_notes> except that it creates the intervals on the fly based on the
I<root_frequency> supplied. Handy if you have a list of frequencies, and need
those converted to cents or ratios.

=item B<set_notes> I<array_or_array_ref>

Sets the notes. Can either be an array, or an array reference, ideally
containing values in ratios or cents as per the Scala scale file specification,
as an exception will be thrown if these ideals are not met.

NOTE cents with no value past the decimal must be quoted in code, as otherwise
Perl converts the value to C<1200> which the code then turns into the integer
ratio C<1200/1> instead of what should be C<2/1>. B<read_scala> does not suffer
this problem, as it is looking for the literal dot, and that is a different
code path than what happens for ratios.

  $scala->set_notes(250.9, 483.3, 715.6, 951.1, '1200.0');

=item B<write_scala> I<filename>

Writes a scala file. Will throw some kind of exception if anything at all is
wrong, such as not having scala data loaded in the object. Like B<read_scala>
alternatively accepts I<file> or I<fh> hash keys, along with a I<binmode>
option to set the output encoding.

  $scala->write_scala('out.scl');
  $scala->write_scala( file => 'out.scl', binmode => ':crlf' );
  $scala->write_scala( fh => $output_fh );

Data will likely not be written until the I<fh> passed is closed. If this
seems surprising, see L<http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html> to learn
why it is not.

=head2 Known Issues

Negative cents are likely not handled well, or at all. The specification frowns
on negative ratios, but does allow for negative cents, so converting such
negative cents to ratios (which do not support negative values) might yield
unexpected or wrong results. Only 0.36% of the scala scale archive file scales
contain negative cents.

Scales, tunings, and temperament would be good music theory topics to read up
on, e.g. chapters in "Musicmathics, volume 1" by Gareth Loy, among other
in-depth treatments stemming from the no few centuries of development behind
music theory.
