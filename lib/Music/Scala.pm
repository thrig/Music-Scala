  # or cents, note the quoting on .0 value
  $scala->set_notes(250.9, 483.3, 715.6, 951.1, '1200.0');

  # MIDI equal temperament algos for comparison
  $scala->pitch2freq(69);
  $scala->freq2pitch(440);

And more; see also the C<eg/> and C<t/> directories of the distribution
of this module for example code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scala scale support for Perl: reading, writing, setting, and interval to
frequency conversion methods are provided. The L</"SEE ALSO"> section
links to the developer pages for the specification, along with an
archive of scala files that define various tunings and temperaments.

=head2 SEVERAL WORDS REGARDING FLOATING POINT NUMBERS

Frequencies derived from scala scale calculations will likely need to be
rounded due to floating point number representation limitations:

  # octave, plus default concert pitch of 440, so expect 880
  my $scala = Music::Scala->new->set_notes('1200.000');

  $scala->interval2freq(1);   # 879.999999999999        (maybe)

  sprintf "%.*f", 0, $scala->interval2freq(1);   # 880  (for sure)

For more information, see:

L<http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html> "What
Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic".
David Goldberg, Computing Surveys, March 1991.

=head1 METHODS

Methods will B<die> or B<croak> under various conditions, mostly related
to bad input. B<new> would be a good one to start with.

=over 4

=item B<cents2ratio> I<cents>, [ I<precision> ]

Converts a value in cents (e.g. 1200) to a ratio (e.g. 2). An optional
precision for C<sprintf> can be supplied; the default precision is 2.

=item B<freq2pitch> I<frequency>

Converts the passed frequency (Hz) to the corresponding MIDI pitch
number using the MIDI algorithm (equal temperament), as influenced by
the I<concertfreq> setting. Unrelated to scala, but perhaps handy for
comparison with results from B<interval2freq>.

This method *is not* influenced by the scala scale data.

=item B<get_binmode>

Returns the current C<binmode> layer setting, C<undef> by default.

=item B<get_cents>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala, except converted to cents
(notes may either be ratios or values in cents). Throws an exception if
the notes have not been set by some previous method.

=item B<get_concertfreq>

Returns the concert frequency presently set in the object. 440 (Hz) is
the default.

=item B<get_concertpitch>

Returns the MIDI pitch number that the I<concertfreq> maps to. 69 by
default (as that is the MIDI number of A440).

=item B<get_description>

Returns the description of the scala data. This will be the empty string
if no description was read or set prior.

=item B<get_notes>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala, but throws an exception if
this field has not been set by some previous method. The notes are
either real numbers (representing values in cents, or 1/1200 of an
octave (these may be negative)) or otherwise integer ratios (e.g.
C<3/2> or C<2>).

  $scala->read_scala(file => $some_file);
  my @notes = $scala->get_notes;
  if (@notes == 12) { ...

The implicit C<1/1> for unison is not contained in the list of notes;
the first element is for the 2nd degree of the scale (e.g. the minor
second of a 12-tone scale).

=item B<get_ratios>

Returns, as a list, the "notes" of the scala, except converted to ratios
(notes may either be ratios or values in cents). Throws an exception if
the notes have not been set by some previous method.

=item B<interval2freq> I<intervals ...>

Converts a list of passed interval numbers (list or single array
reference) to frequencies (in Hz) that are returned as a list. Interval
numbers are integers, C<0> for unison, C<1> for the first interval
(which would be a "minor 2nd" for a 12-note scale, but something
different for scales of other sizes), and so on up to the "octave" (13%
of the scala archive consists of non-octave bounded scales). Negative
intervals take the frequency in the other direction, e.g. C<-1> for what
in a 12-note system would be a minor 2nd downwards. Intervals past the
"octave" consist of however many "octaves" are present in the scale,
plus whatever remainder inside the "octave," if any.

Conversions are based on the I<concertfreq> setting, which is 440Hz by
default. Use B<set_concertfreq> to adjust this, for example to base the
conversion around the frequency of MIDI pitch 60:

  $scala->set_concertfreq(261.63);

Some scala files note what this value should be in the comments or
description, or it may vary based on the specific software or
instruments involved.

There is no error checking for nonsense conditions: an interval of a
15th makes no sense for a xylophone with only 10 keys in total. Audit
the contents of the scala scale file to learn what its limits are, or
screen for appropriate scales (the B<is_octavish> check may help),
depending on the application.

=item B<is_octavish>

Returns true if the scala scale has an ultimate ratio of 2:1, as well as
no negative or repeated ratios; false otherwise. Throws an exception if
no scala scale is loaded.

=item B<new> I<optional_params>, ...

Constructor. Returns object. Accepts various optional parameters.

=over 4

=item *

I<binmode> - sets a default C<binmode> layer that will be used when
reading scala files (unless that B<read_scala> call has a different
I<binmode> passed to it). Given that the scala file specification
demands "ISO 8859-1 'Latin-1' or the ASCII subset", and uses Internet
linefeeds, a reasonable default would be:

  Music::Scala->new( binmode => ':encoding(iso-8859-1):crlf' );

Output encoding may also need to be set, if in particular the
I<description> field of the scala definition will be printed or saved
elsewhere. See L<perluniintro> for details. Note that both B<read_scala>
and B<write_scala> will use this same global I<binmode> value if no
I<binmode> is passed to those methods.

Note that Perl on Windows systems tends to turn on C<:crlf>. For scala
scale files, it probably should be specified, regardless of the
operating system.

=item *

I<concertfreq> - sets the reference value (in Hertz) for conversions
using the B<interval2freq> method. By default this is 440Hz.

=item *

I<file> - filename, if specified, that will be passed to B<read_scala>.

=item *

I<fh> - file handle, if specified, that will be passed to B<read_scala>,
but only if I<file> is not specified.

=item *

I<MAX_LINES> - sets the maximum number of lines to read while parsing
data. Sanity check high water mark in the event bad input is passed.

=item B<notes2cents> I<notes ...>

Given a list of notes, returns a list of corresponding cents. Used
internally by the B<get_cents> method.

=item B<notes2ratios> I<notes ...>

Given a list of notes, returns a list of corresponding ratios. Used
internally by the B<get_ratios> and B<interval2freq> methods.

=item B<pitch2freq> I<MIDI_pitch_number>

Converts the given MIDI pitch number to a frequency using the MIDI
conversion algorithm (equal temperament), as influenced by the
I<concertfreq> setting.

This method *is not* influenced by the scala scale data.

=item B<ratio2cents> I<ratio>, [ I<precision> ]

Converts a ratio (e.g. 2) to a value in cents (e.g. 1200). An optional
precision for C<sprintf> can be supplied; the default precision is 2.

=item B<read_scala> I<filename>

Parses a scala file. Will throw some kind of exception if anything at
all is wrong with the input. Use the C<get_*> methods to obtain the
scala data thus parsed. Comments in the input file are ignored, so
anything subsequently written using B<write_scala> will lack those. All
ratios are made implicit by this method; that is, a C<2> would be
qualified as C<2/1>.

As an alternative, accepts also I<file> or I<fh> hash keys, along with
I<binmode> as in the B<new> method:

  $scala->read_scala('somefile');
  $scala->read_scala( file => 'file.scl', binmode => ':crlf' );
  $scala->read_scala( fh   => $input_fh );

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_binmode> I<binmode_layer>

Sets the default C<binmode> layer used in B<read_scala> and
B<write_scala> methods (unless a custom I<binmode> argument is passed to
those calls).

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_by_frequency> I<root_frequency>, I<frequencies...>

Given a root frequency as the first argument, performs the equivalent of
B<set_notes> except creating the intervals on the fly based on the
I<root_frequency> supplied. Handy if you have a list of frequencies from
somewhere, and need that converted to cents or ratios.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_concertfreq> I<frequency>

Sets the concert frequency to the specified value (in Hz). Will throw an
exception if the input does not look like a positive number.

=item B<set_concertpitch> I<pitch_number>

Sets the MIDI pitch number tied to the I<concertfreq>. Changing this
will affect the B<freq2pitch> and B<pitch2freq> methods.

=item B<set_description> I<description>

Sets the description. Should be a string.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_notes> I<array_or_array_ref>

Sets the notes. Can be either an array, or an array reference, ideally
containing values in ratios or cents as per the Scala scale file
specification, and the method will throw an exception if these ideals
are not met.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

NOTE cents with no value past the decimal must be quoted in code, as
otherwise Perl converts the value to C<1200> which the code then turns
into the integer ratio C<1200/1> instead of what should be C<2/1>.
B<read_scala> does not suffer this problem, as it is looking for the
literal dot (that nothing is removing automatically) and that is a
different code path than what happens for ratios.

  $scala->set_notes(250.9, 483.3, 715.6, 951.1, '1200.0');

=item B<write_scala> I<filename>

Writes a scala file. Will throw some kind of exception if anything at
all is wrong, such as not having scala data loaded in the object. Like
B<read_scala> alternatively accepts I<file> or I<fh> hash keys, along
with a I<binmode> option to set the output encoding.

  $scala->write_scala('out.scl');
  $scala->write_scala( file => 'out.scl', binmode => ':crlf' );
  $scala->write_scala( fh => $output_fh );

Data will likely not be written until the I<fh> passed is closed. If
this seems surprising, see L<http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html>
to learn why it is not.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=head2 Known Issues

Negative cents are likely not handled well, or at all. The
specification frowns on negative ratios, but does allow for negative
cents, so converting such negative cents to ratios might yield
unexpected or wrong results.

Scales, tunings, and temperament would be good music theory topics to
read up on, e.g. chapters in "Musicmathics, volume 1" by Gareth Loy
(among many other more in-depth treatments stemming from the more than
one centuries of development behind these topics).
