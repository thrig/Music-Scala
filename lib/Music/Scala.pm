=head1 NAME

Music::Scala - Scala scale support for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Music::Scala;
  my $scala = Music::Scala->new;

  $scala->read_scala( file => 'bossart-muri.scl' );

  $scala->get_description;  # "Victor Ferdinand Bossart's..."
  $scala->get_notes;        # [80.4499, 195.11250, ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scala scale (C<*.scl> file) support for Perl. The L</"SEE ALSO">
section links to the developer pages for the specification, along with
an archive of scala files for various tunings and temperaments.

Warning! This is a new module. Features or handling in particular of
cents versus ratios may change as I figure out the code. Additional
methods will likely be added to assist with the task of calculating
frequencies given particular notes or pitches or whatnot, but for now
there is reasonable C<*.scl> parsing support.

=head1 METHODS

Methods may B<die> or B<croak> under various conditions. B<new> would be
a good one to start with.

=over 4

=item B<get_description>

Returns the description (a string, possibly the empty one) of the scala
data, but throws an exception if B<read_scala> has not yet parsed a
scala definition into the object.

=item B<get_notes>

Returns the notes (or rather "interval outcomes" for how that interval
and starting frequency must create the new frequency of that new note)
of the scala data (as an array reference), but throws an exception if
B<read_scala> has not yet parsed a scala definition into the object. The
notes may be either real numbers (values in cents, possibly even
negative, noted by a C<.> somewhere in them) or otherwise integer ratios
(e.g. C<3/2>) that denote ratios.

=item B<new> I<optional_params>, ...

Constructor. Returns object. Accepts various optional parameters.

=over 4

=item *

I<binmode> - sets a default C<binmode> layer that will be used when
reading scala files (unless that B<read_scala> call has a different
I<binmode> passed to it). Given that the scala file specification
demands "ISO 8859-1 'Latin-1' or the ASCII subset", and uses Internet
linefeeds, a reasonable default would be:

  Music::Scala->new( binmode => ':encoding(iso-8859-1):crlf' );

Output encoding may also need to be set, if in particular the
I<description> field of the scala definition will be printed or saved
elsewhere. See L<perluniintro> for details.

=item *

I<MAX_LINES> - sets the maximum number of lines to read while parsing
data. Sanity check high water mark in the event bad input is passed.

=back

=item B<read_scala> I<file =E<gt> 'filename'> | I<fh =E<gt> $fh>

Parses a scala I<file> (or instead filehandle via the I<fh> option),
perhaps also with a I<binmode> specification (same as documented under
the B<new> method). Will throw some kind of exception if anything at all
is wrong with the input. Use the C<get_*> methods to obtain the scala
data thus parsed.

Comments in the input file are ignored, so anything subsequently written
using B<write_scala> would lack those.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_description> I<description>

Sets the description. Should be a string. Returns the Music::Scala
object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<set_notes> I<array_ref>

Sets the notes. Should be an array reference, ideally containing values
in ratios or cents as per the Scala scale file specification. Returns
the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

=item B<write_scala> I<file =E<gt> 'filename'> | I<fh =E<gt> $fh>

Writes a scala I<file> (or instead to the I<fh> filehandle), perhaps
also with a I<binmode> specification (as for other methods, above). Will
throw some kind of exception if anything at all is wrong, such as not
having scala data loaded in the object.

Returns the Music::Scala object, so can be chained with other calls.

Scales, tunings, and temperament would be good music theory topics to
read up on, e.g. chapters in "Musicmathics, volume 1" by Gareth Loy
(among many other more in-depth treatments stemming from the more than
one centuries of development behind these topics).
